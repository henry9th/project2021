# Project 2021 


## Objective

Provide a platform for young adults that want to pursue careers that do not require a traditional 4-year college degree. Think Glassdoor but for careers like plumbing, electrician, etc. 

For those who plan on not attending a traditional 4-year college, there is often not enough resources or guidance on what to pursue. The platform should aim to do the following

- Provide a glossary of available careers that do not require higher education
    - Contain information such as preparation requirements, average salary in different parts of the nation, and other considerations 

- Provide a platform for mentors and mentees so that those curious or interested in pursuing the career have a place to ask questions from those already in the field 
  
- A questionnaire that can help point someone to careers that might interest them or fit what requirements they're looking for (ex: short-prep time, good WLB, ...)
